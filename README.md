# Adaptive Frontend MVP (ML-Powered UI)

An experimental project showcasing the power of frontend engineering by building a fully client-side **adaptive UI** that leverages **Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js)** to dynamically adjust layouts based on user behavior.

## 🚀 Vision
This project aims to demonstrate how frontend developers can go beyond traditional UI building and introduce real-time intelligence directly in the browser. By using **React**, **Redux**, and **TensorFlow.js**, the UI learns from user behavior patterns (clicks, scroll depth, and engagement) and adapts itself to enhance the user experience — all without backend support.

## 🎯 Features
- **Behavior-Driven Layout Adaptation**
- **Client-side ML Inference using TensorFlow.js**
- **Real-time User Tracking via Custom React Hooks**
- **Global State Management with Redux Toolkit**
- **Dynamic Component Rendering Based on Predictions**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React (Frontend Framework)
- Redux Toolkit (State Management)
- TensorFlow.js (Client-Side Machine Learning)
- Custom React Hooks (Behavior Tracking)

└── index.js
```

## 📖 Concept
The system tracks user engagement in real-time (e.g., how many clicks or how far they scroll) and feeds this behavior into a lightweight ML model running in the browser. Based on model predictions, the dashboard dynamically adjusts its layout to suit the user's interaction style.

## 🧠 Why?
- Showcase the **depth and intelligence of modern frontend engineering**.
- Promote **ML-powered personalization** in UI/UX.
- Build a proof-of-concept for intelligent dashboards and adaptive design systems.
